# Current tasks

* Refactor existing code
* Easy configuration and deployment

# Proposed features

* Logging

  - e.g. "prosurfer: !log <message>" should be appended to a file
    somewhere. Maybe a JSON file with the related metadata as well.

* Memos

  - Memos that are displayed when someone comes online or when someone
    speaks.

* Links

  - General link recommendations
    e.g. "prosurfer: !link htbah"

  - Documentation/Reference lookup
    e.g. "prosurfer: !doc loop"

* users
  - "last seen <username>"

* Other features that will come in handy while programming.
